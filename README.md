This is a library that supports pulse-width modulation (PWM) control on the 74HC595 IC using the ESP32 microcontroller, compatible with the Arduino Framework.

This library is a modified version of the ShiftRegisterPWM library (https://github.com/Simsso/ShiftRegister-PWM-Library) to support the ESP32 on the Arduino Framework (currently, it only works on the ESP32).
